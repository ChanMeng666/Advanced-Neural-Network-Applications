# Advanced Neural Network Applications

## Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of neural network technologies in analysing and processing two distinct datasets aimed at fish classification through a perceptron model and heat influx prediction through a linear neuron model. It highlights the utility of neural networks in practical applications and showcases manual training techniques to optimise model performance.

## Datasets
1. **Fish Dataset**: Contains measurements of scale ring diameters to classify fish as either Canadian or Alaskan.
2. **Heat Influx Dataset**: Features data on heat influx from the north and south elevations of a house, used to simulate and predict heat influx across different sections of the house.

## Models
### Perceptron Model
- Applies the perceptron algorithm to classify fish based on ring diameters, iteratively adjusting weights to achieve classification goals.
- Implemented in Python, the code includes weight updates, drawing of classification boundaries, and assessment of classification accuracy.

### Linear Neuron Models
- Employs a single linear neuron to predict heat influx into homes.
- Implements two training modalities: a single-input and a dual-input model, comparing their performances.
- Extends the application to 3D visualisations of the predicted heat influx against actual data, enhancing the interpretability and utility of the model in practical scenarios.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn) are installed.
3. Prior to running the code, verify that data files are placed in the correct path.
